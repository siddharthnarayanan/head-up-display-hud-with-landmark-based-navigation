The interface was designed in accordance to basic AR annotation heuristics to make the landmark salient in context of the driving environment,and map it to a navigational instruction. Moreover, by using landmarks instead of traditional distance metrics (miles or kilometers) like many existing GPS systems, the interface promotes recognition of the actual landmark and promotes learning of the route.Since the user, no longer has to calculate and map out the distances from UI to their cognitive mental model, we argue that this will also reduce the required cognitive bandwidth for navigation. The interface design has also been kept consistent with the real world and has borrowed icons and labels from the familiar navigational paradigm. Finally the user is also given control over the order and scrolling of the rotating menu if they desire to skip ahead or move back to a landmark on the list.The initial prototype was refined through a number of iterations following user inputs and feedback. Well researched problems in AR HUD displays such as occlusion, distraction,color, transparency were encountered and iteratively reduced to finally result in the user evaluation prototype.
